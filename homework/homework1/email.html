                <p>Ray Tomlinson is universally credited as the creator of email as part of a program for ARPANET in 1971. 
                However, in 1978, Shiva Ayyadurai began his work on an email system for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey as a 14 year old.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>User composes the message using a email client or web mail. Email client is a software which resides on our computer and is used to 
                    send and receive emails. Microsoft Outlook or Thunderbird is a example of email client. 
                    Web mail is web application which works on Internet browser and allows user to send and receive email messages.</p></li>
                    <li><p>After sending the message the email is stored in the SMTP server. SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server 
                    is server which allows a user to send the emails to another user.</p></li>
                    <li><p>SMTP server looks for the recipient’s email address in the DNS server record. If the record is found the message is send to the found address else the message sending fails.</p></li>
                   <li><p>Same as SMTP server there is a email server which takes care of Incoming messages. User has email clients configured with these servers.</p></li>
                   <li><p>If a new message is available on the email server, user can access them via email client or web mail client.</p></li>
                </ul> 
                 
                
                <p>Email has three protocols: IMAP, POP3, SMTP. They all work upon the Internet protocol.</p>
